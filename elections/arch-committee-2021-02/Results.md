# Architecture Committee Election Results: February 2021

Two nominations were received for the February 2021 elections:

- [`Peng Tao`](https://github.com/bergwolf)
- [`Samuel Ortiz`](https://github.com/sameo)

Two seats were available, so elections were over sooner.

The two members were (re-)admitted to the Architecture Committee on 2021-03-10
for another 12 month term.
